Mondo.net's summary of the principles of such a network: 

  
**1. Decentralized**

The network should not be operated, maintained, or in any way reliant upon 
a single or minimally differentiated set of entities or technologies. No individual, 
entity or group should be central to the network to the extent that their absence 
would measurably impact its functionality or scope. Network participation should 
not require access to fixed, physical infrastructure of any sort. 

  
**2. Universally Accessible**

The requisite technology and expertise required to participate in the network 
should be available at minimal cost and effort to every human being on the 
planet. Furthermore, all users should be able to extend the network’s content 
and functionality to suit their own needs, or those of others. No aspect of 
the network’s functioning should be reliant upon proprietary technologies, 
information or capital. 

  
**3. Censor-proof**

The network should be resistant to both regulatory and technical attempts to 
limit the nature of the information shared, restrict usage by given individuals 
or communities, or render the network, or any portion of it, inoperable or 
inaccessible. 

  
**4. Surveillance-proof**

The network should enable users to choose exactly what information they share 
with whom, and to participate anonymously if they so desire. Users should only 
have access to information if they are the designated recipients, or if it 
has been published openly. 

  
**5. Secure**

The network should be organized in a way that minimizes the risk of malicious 
attacks or engineering failure. Information exchanged on the network should 
meet or exceed the delivery rate and reliability of information exchanged via 
the Internet. 

  
**6. Scalable**

The network should be organized with the expectation that its scale could reach 
or even exceed that of today’s Internet. Special care should be taken to address 
to the challenge of maintaining efficiency without the presence of a centralized 
backbone. 

  
**7. Permanent**

The network’s density and redundancy should be great enough that, despite its 
ad hoc nature, it will persistently operate on a broad scale, and be available 
in full to any user within range of another peer. 

  
**8. Fast (enough)**

The network should always achieve whatever speed is required for a “bottom 
line” level of social and cultural participation. At present, we assert that 
the network’s data transfer rate should, at a minimum, be enough for voice-over-IP 
(VoIP) communications, and low-bitrate streaming video. 

  
**9. Independent**

While the network will have the capacity to exchange information with Internet 
users and nodes, it should be able to operate independently, as well. A large-scale 
failure or closure of Internet infrastructure and content should have minimal 
effect on the network’s operations. 

  
**10. Evolvable**

The network should be built with future development in mind. The platform should 
be flexible enough to support technologies, protocols and modes of usage that 
have not yet been developed." ([http://www.acceler8or.com/2011/07/mondonet-fights-the-internet-power-an-interview-with-adam-sinnreich/][4])
