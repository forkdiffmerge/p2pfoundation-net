#  Introductory Citation

"**Instead of further going down the corporate lane of Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, 
Google and Facebook, I propose to go back to the original architecture of Internet 
as public infrastructure with decentralized nodes. It may be romantic to insist 
on the distributed nature of networks but it is a necessary political demand. 
Net criticism is a toothless project without a utopian dimension. Even if internet 
itself had a military origin in the Cold War, and is now dominated by equally 
destructive force of greedy venture capitalists, backed up by libertarian gurus. 
Let’s rethink the public sphere: another internet is possible**!" 

- Geert Lovink [[1]][57]

  

#  Introduction

This is a specialization of our general [Technology][58] section, focusing 
more explicitly on the 'true internet' or distributed P2P infrastructures. 
 

This documentation project was originally compiled in the context of the [ContactCon][59] 
conference to be held on October 20, 2010 in NYC. 

**Main overview page [NextNet][60] and associated [Category][61], is maintained by [ContactCon][59] participants; the proposed [Autonomous Internet Road Map][62] is maintained by Robert Steele.**

**Watch this video for context**: [Eben Moglen on the Four Forces Arrayed Against

#  A Credo

... which could be ours as well, written by Markus Sabadello for the versionvega 
project [[4]][80]: 

  

	... that client-server architectures have become a dominant form of organization.
	
	... that the above is true in the world of information technologies as well as in real-life societies.
	
	

... **that the principle of these architectures - the flow of goods and information from the few to the many - has evolved not because it is the best solution to common problems, but because of a fundamental drive towards strict hierarchical control.**

... **that many existing web applications, while promising to deliver open communication, self-fulfillment and creative liberation, do in fact serve to exploit as well as manipulate people's data and behavioral patterns.**

	... that in recent years a strong development towards centralization of online 
	services could be observed. 
	... that this centralization tends to harm rather than make good use of the 
	full potential of today's information technologies. 
	... that insufficient privacy and freedom are only the most obvious of many problems inherent to today's client-server patterns.
	
	... that in human history an overflowing concentration of control and power has never been beneficial for the people. 
	... **that a peer-to-peer architecture can implement in better ways most applications 
	that are currently designed in a client-server fashion**. 
	... that a peer-to-peer architecture furthermore gives rise to an entire new 
	class of applications and possibilities.

##  "Freedom requires infrastructure

A man who has no tools to acquire his necessities of life is a slave to his 
necessities. Given those tools, he becomes a slave to the labour required to 
fruitfully use them. Only by transcending each difficulty as it comes, in a 
process not dissimilar to metasystem transitions, can the individual achieve 
freedom. 

Similarly, if at any point the individual becomes removed from the infrastructure 
that allows him any of the previous metasystem transitions, then he becomes 
a slave to those who control that infrastructure." ( - Smari McCarthy (FCF 
Discussion, February 2011) 

  

##  Tools for concentrated power vs. tools for diffuse power

**"There are tools, technologies and discourses which favour diffuse power, 
and tools, technologies and discourses which favour concentrated power.** Today 
the concentrated power mechanisms have the upper hand. All it would take to 
turn the tide is for the diffuse power mechanisms to gain the upper hand. I’d 
speculate that diffuse power mechanisms may have gained the upper hand in some 
fields in the 1960s-70s, and only the recomposition of capitalism as neoliberalism 
(with new technologies and discourses) saved it at this point (e.g. states 
were losing guerrilla wars to popular forces across the board in this period). 
If diffuse power retained the upper hand then any authoritarian regime created 
on the backs of diffuse power would itself be vulnerable to a reactivation 
of diffuse power." 

- Andy Robinson [[5]][81]

  

##  The ambivalence of technology

"Imagine "change" not as a chain of steps (one after another, as the chain 
of production), but think of change as an an eco-system of spheres where there 
is not starting point but spheres that interact and depend one to the other. 
As production goes from a chain of production to the eco-systemic forms of 
online creation communities or peer production, the same happen to the change 
of the system. I think we have to be open to the idea of starting the change 
from the diverse spheres and see how they affect to each other, instead of 
trying to draft first a starting line. Furthermore, the tools have ambivalences, 
they open possibilities of freedom at a time that they open possibilities of 
control and exploitation. Dealing with that ambivalence is very difficult (there 
is not right fix solutions one for all situations; which it is a pity, because 
it would be easier just to believe fervently in a solution and stick to it 
centuries after centuries); but I think it would be a mistake to loose the 
opportunities of entering in to the eco-system of change though finding a way 
in the ambivalence. We need to learn to put the ambivalence in the side of 
the principles we defend, more than searching situations in which there is 
not." 

- Mayo Fuster (FCF Discussion, February 2011) 

#  Introduction

There are four main forces arrayed against a future network of free and open 
data [[6]][82]. 

*  Content providers want to insure that their every product is not only the only thing you are allowed access to, but that you only access it in ways that insure that you pay for the privilege. 

*  Data miners want your every move online to be traceable, your every desire at their fingertips, so they can sell you stuff. 

*  The networks want every bit you access metered, measured, and your every transaction subject to scrutiny and control. 

*  Various “elites” want to control what you think, what you say, and what you do, all to insure that you will never be a threat to their “power”

To date, Sinnreich and his team have developed a set of “social specifications” describing the functionalities required of MondoNet, and are in the process of mapping these specifications to open technological platforms."

#  Technologies by Layer

##  The OSI Model

_"The [Open Systems Interconnection model][147] (OSI model) is a product of the [Open Systems Interconnection][148] effort at the [International Organization for Standardization][149]. It is a way of sub-dividing a communications system into smaller parts called layers. A layer is a collection of similar functions that provide services to the layer above it and receives services from the layer below it. On each layer, an instance provides services to the instances at the layer above and requests service from the layer below."_

##  Application Layer

The question is: how will existing and future p2p software run and work on 
the distributed internet? Some of it may work with little or no change. Some 
may need to have an interface to work with multiple internet(s).

It allows you to do work in parallel, to load balance processing, and to call functions between languages. It can be used in a variety of applications, from high-availability web sites to the transport of database replication events. In other words, it is the nervous system for how distributed processing communicates." 
*  [MogileFS][163] [http://www.danga.com/mogilefs/][164] "MogileFS is our open source distributed filesystem." Runs mostly on Linux at this time. 
*  [Memcached][165] [http://memcached.org/][166] "Free & open source, high-performance, distributed memory object caching system, generic in nature, but intended for use in speeding up dynamic web applications by alleviating database load.

The iRODS system is based on expertise gained through a decade of applying the SRB technology in support of Data Grids, Digital Libraries, Persistent Archives, and Real-time Data Systems. iRODS management policies (sets of assertions these communities make about their digital collections) are characterized in iRODS Rules and state information. At the iRODS core, a Rule Engine interprets the Rules to decide how the system is to respond to various requests and conditions. iRODS is open source under a BSD license."

##   P2P Wireless Meshworks and Telephony 

To read: [Peer to Peer User Owned Communications Infrastructure][228]. Gordon 
Cook. Cook Report, March-April 2012. [[38]][229]: a very detailed treatment 
of the alternative, user-owned p2p infrastructures that are emerging, and detailing 
in particular the case study of Isaac Wilder’s FreedomTower meshwork. 

1. 
[Ad-hoc Dark (roast) Network Travel Mug][230] - Travel mug designed for creating ad-hoc “dark” networks for communication along a morning commute using an Arduino and an XBee module. 
2. 
[Aidphone Flybox][231] - box with inmarsat terminal, wifi access point, and GSM basestation to provide internet & mobile phone service to indy journalistsin crisis situations 
3. The [Commotion][186] Wireless Project: 'device-as-infrastrucure' distribution communications platform 
4. 
[Ekiga][232]: an open source SoftPhone, Video Conferencing and Instant Messenger application over the Internet. 
5. 
[GNU Free Call][233] is a new project to develop and deploy secure self-organized communication services worldwide for private use and for public administration. We use the open standard SIP protocol and GNU SIP Witch to create secured [Peer-to-Peer Mesh Calling Networks][234]

6. 
[Mesh Potato][235]: a new device for providing low-cost telephony and Internet in areas where alternative access either doesn’t exist or is too expensive. 
7. 
[Open BSC][236]: [[39]][237] OpenBSC is a GSM network in a box software, implementing the minimal necessary parts to build a small, self-contained GSM network. 
8. 
[Open BTS][111]: OpenBTS is an open-source Unix application that uses the Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP) to present a GSM air interface ("Um") to standard GSM handset and uses the Asterisk® software PBX to connect calls. The combination of the ubiquitous GSM air interface with VoIP backhaul could form the basis of a new type of cellular network that could be deployed and operated at substantially lower cost than existing technologies in greenfields in the developing world. 
9. 
[Open-Mesh][114] [[40]][115], Open Mesh is different from other efforts to build local networks in that their direction is not the connection between different nodes separated by larger distance but the extension of existing internet coverage inside buildings, and between adjacent structures. 
10. 
[OpenMesh Project][116]: global project born after the Egyptian blackout 
11. 
[Peep Wireless][238] is proposing a peer-to-peer alternative to the hegemony of cell providers that could provide low-cost mobile connectivity to low-income populations. 
12. 
[Pirate Box][128] [[41]][129] is a self-contained mobile collaboration and file sharing device. Simply turn it on to transform any space into a free and open file sharing network. 
13. 
[Project Byzantium][239]: communicating without access to the internet 
14. 
[Project Kleinrock][240]: an attempt to create an autonomous and decentralized "second layer" of the Internet, which can operate without the use of ISP's [[42]][241]

15. 
[Ronja][242] [[43]][243] - wireless networking device with range of 1.4km & communication speed of 10Mbps full duplex 
16. 
[ROBIN][244] [[44]][245] - open source mesh firmware that can technically run on any device that support [Open WRT][122]. ROBIN networks can be managed centrally through the use of dashboards like Surreal ([http://surrealwifi.com][246]) and Robin-Dash. forums here: [http://robin.forumup.it/][247]

17. 
[Serval][248] [[45]][249] ; the only working mesh solution that uses off the shelf phones and off the shelf unlicensed spectrum and existing phone numbers, and can work with absolutely no infrastructure. 
18. 
[Village Telco][250] [[46]][251]: The goal of the project is to render local telephony in developing countries to be so cheap as to be virtually free. Thanks to advances in Open Source telephony software and the dramatic decrease in the cost of wireless broadband technology, we think this is entirely possible. 

  
  

Local projects: 

1. 
[FLO Farm][252], Pennsylvania [[47]][253]

2. Grinnell, Iowa - [[48]][254]; the [Free Network Movement][255] is building a mesh network for the community 
3. 
[WasabiNet][256], working to provide low-cost Mesh Wifi to the Benton Park West neighborhood in St. Louis, MO!

#  To be refactored into this page

*  [http://anonnews.org/?p=press&a=item&i=554][335] The idea is to write a how-to on building mesh networks. The n00bs must understand it. Mesh networks are usefull, as they cannot be censored nor shut down. 

Later on that How-to can become part of Anonymous' uber-secret handbook regarding 
safety. Version 0.2.0, a downloadable .pdf, can be found there [http://goo.gl/SuY0f][336]
